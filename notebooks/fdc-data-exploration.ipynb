    "\n",
    "### The Five Data Types of FoodData Central\n",
    "\n",
    "1. USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR)\n",
    "    - last version labeled SR Legacy and released in 2018\n",
    "    - primary food-composition data type in US for decades\n",
    "    - provides average values from selected foods in the marketplace, derived from analyses of composites, calculations, and/or literature\n",
    "    - analytical nutrient profiles were determined for foods in the marketplace and selected based on the market share, representing an estimate of average exposure across the United States\n",
    "    - values will become less relevant as the food supply evolves over time while SR remains static\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. Global Branded Food Products Database (GBFPD): database of food products based on commercial label data\n",
    "    - includes data from various groups\n",
    "    - data centers on nutrients required by FDA food labeling, but additional data may also be available\n",
    "    - nutrient data that appears on branded and private label foods and are voluntarily provided by the food industry\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. Foundation Foods (FF)\n",
    "    - goal is to provide information on foods used to make more complex foods (such as those from GBFPD)\n",
    "    - provides information on single-ingredient foods\n",
    "    - provides analytical values for components of individual food samples (NOT composite values)\n",
    "    - provides data including number of samples, sampling location, date of collection, analytical approaches used, agricultural information (e.g. genotype, growing location, production practices)\n",
    "    - intended to be used in coordination with food-composition data from other USDA datasets (e.g. Nutrient Uptake and Outcomes Network, the Agricultural Collaborative Research Outcomes System, Economic Research Service)\n",
    "    - considered the future of USDA food information\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "4. Experimental Foods (EF): data type for food-composition data within the context of an experimental design or derived from new analytical methodology research\n",
    "    - foods produced, acquired, or studied under unique conditions (e.g. alternative management systems, experimental genotypes, or research/analytical protocols)\n",
    "    - set of experiments and results\n",
    "    - implemented for an intended audience of researchers\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "5. Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS): a data type developed by Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center's Food Surveys Research Group for the purposes of national nutrition monitoring (released every 2 years in coordination with the release of \"What We Eat in America\" as part of the NHANES). \n",
    "    - provides nutrient values for the foods and beverages reported in What We Eat in America (the dietary intake component of the National Heath and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES))\n",
    "    - nutrient profiles for a majority of foods and beverages were derived via calculation utilizing 2 or more ingredient codes from FF and SR Legacy data\n",
    "\n",
    "\"USDAâ€™s FoodData Central: what is it and why is it needed today?\" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522001794?via%3Dihub)\n",
